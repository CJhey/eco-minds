## Site
I made this page with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), using the [Blowfish](https://blowfish.page) template.

### Editing
This site has been mostly edited on [LazyVim](https://lazyvim.org), though sometimes I just use the [Gnome Text Editor](https://apps.gnome.org/TextEditor/).

## Photographs
Photos are credited where necessary, but the featured content image is a photo by my photographer friend [Emmanuel](https://kloppervok.com).

### Photo gear
Though not entirely relevant, images I myself shot were taken either on a Canon 5DII, a Lumix GX80, a Fuji X-Half if digital, or a Fuji GW690 or a Contax T2 if film.

## Other Images
Images in this website are acquired from various sources, and I will credit them accordinglyly. The [background](https://edermunizz.itch.io/free-pixel-art-forest) has been drawn by [edermunizz](https://edermunizz.itch.io/). The current logo was done on [Canva](https://www,canva.com) with simple geometric figures.

Though I'd rather avoid using AI art, I will also list it accordingly in case I do use it.
