ECO-MINDS is a project about plant cognition and what happens when we take it seriously in terms of what is _valuable_ for the plant. Does cognition enable some sense of subjecthood? Does perceiving the world in the modalities available to a plant represent the creation of _value_ for the plant in some way?

This project is centered around biosemiotics--the idea that organisms use signs, and that these effect fundamental biological functions that are not describable solely through mechanistic views--, while also following current advances in the philosophy of plant cognition.

And there is probably no better place in the world to work with plant cognition than MINTLab!
